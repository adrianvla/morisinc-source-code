    <h1>Why I built this</h1>
    <p>I began developing mLearn in Summer/Autumn 2024 after starting Japanese in February 2024. Native media were inaccessible at a beginner level.</p>
    <p>I needed an app that enabled immersion with any content—including offline sources—with Anki integration. I tried [a href="https://migaku.com/"]Migaku[/a], but it was not free and did not support my goals for native‑level content.</p>
    <p>That motivated me to build a complete language learning app focused on immersion, even for beginners.</p>
    <p>Because I could not understand most Japanese at the time, I created a live word translator that appends translations based on readings.</p>
    <p>It helped significantly: the first series I watched using mLearn was [a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2098220/"]Hunter x Hunter[/a] with Japanese subtitles and the original dub.</p>
    <p>mLearn helped me reach conversational fluency. I learned over 1,000 words with minimal friction, as I later discovered in an internal database.</p>
    <h1>Planned features</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Chinese and Russian language support</li>
        <li>And Many More...</li>
    </ul>
