    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>We present the design and implementation of a minimalist yet complete 64‑bit RISC processor, built on a Digilent CMOD‑A7 board featuring a Xilinx Artix‑7 FPGA, capable of running Tetris with integrated sound. </p>
    <p>Motivated by the question of whether a processor operating at a modest 40 MHz—slow by modern standards—could support such a game when programmed in assembly, we developed both the processor architecture and a custom assembler. The system includes eight GPIO lines, two 8‑bit PWM outputs for audio, and sixteen 64‑bit registers. Performance evaluation shows an instruction throughput of 1.0 MIPS/MHz, exceeding that of comparable processors such as the STR71xF (0.9) and ESP32 (0.6). </p>
    <p>The design operates at a low power consumption of 0.311 W, demonstrating that a compact, energy‑efficient FPGA‑based processor can achieve smooth game execution with audio support.</p>
