    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>Robotics should support humanity in every possible way, and that society should benefit from technological progress. I also believe that knowledge is a human right and should be freely accessible to all.</p>
    <p>Technologies such as exoskeletons and advanced prosthetics can transform lives.</p>
    <p>As computers approach human-level cognition and emotional understanding and outright true emotions, they could accelerate innovation, science, and society at large. Such capabilities must be developed and deployed responsibly.</p>
    <p>My goal is to bring computer science and robotic technologies to a whole new level.</p>
