    <h1>Why I built this</h1>
    <p>I previously used [a href="https://www.studysmarter.de/"]StudySmarter[/a] to prepare for exams, but encountered instability when creating flashcards rapidly.</p>
    <p>Two days before my Calculus I (Part 1) exam, a significant portion of my flashcards disappeared due to platform issues.</p>
    <p>In response, I built the first prototype of this app in one week and used it for Part 2 of the exam.</p>
    <p>Decks prioritizes stability and fast flashcard creation to protect your work.</p>
